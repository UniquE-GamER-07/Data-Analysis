# Data-analysis

Take excel and turn into visual data like graphs and other things

The main purpose of this repository is to use any excel and be able to access it and make graphs and any kind of edits to it using python and libraries like panda, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot.

I made this to be able to see the carbon emissions of Apple and come up with some predictions.

Anyways Enjoyyyy ðŸ˜ƒ:)
